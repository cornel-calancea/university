 Â©Corneliu Calancea, 2020 This archive contains an implementation of some basic
functions of a router

Flow: - First, the routing table is parsed with the functions in parser.c. For
efficiency reasons, we perform a binary search in the table - arpTable.c
contains the implementation for the ARP table and its functions - in router.c
you'll find the functions related to packet handling. The headers of a packet
are analyzed hierarchically, and handled by various cases. 
getMessageType returns a codified type of the message, according to which we can decide what to do with the packet: forward, handle_arp_request, send_arp_request, handle_arp_reply, handle_echo, or send_icmp.
In case the packet has wrong checksum, it'll be dropped.
At forwarding, the checksum is modified according to RFC1624.
